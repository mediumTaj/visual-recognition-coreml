This Code Pattern was created for developers who want to create intelligent mobile apps powered with IBM Watson for the Apple mobile platform.

It requires basic knowledge of Swift, but if you have background on other programming languages, the code is still simple and fairly straightforward.

Before you begin, you need to make sure you have these softwares versions installed on your machine. **These versions are required to support Core ML**:

* **MacOS 10.11 El Capitan** or later
* **Xcode 9** or later
* **iOS 11** or later (on your iPhone or iPad if you want the application to be on your device)
* **[Carthage 0.29 or later](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage)**
