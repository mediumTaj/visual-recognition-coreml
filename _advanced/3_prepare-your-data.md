In order to create our model, we have to provide training images to the classifier. Take a few minutes to take photos of the cables to prepare our data.

Make sure to take *at least* **10** images of each cable. For best results, change the background, lighting, and any other variables that you can think of! (Once you're done taking photos, use airdrop to transfer the images to your computer)

# Preparing our data
Now we need to prepare our data by classifying each image.
1. Create an empty folder for each *type* of cable

1. Sort through your images, putting each in the correct folder based on the type of cable.
1. Once all of your images are in the correct folder, archive each folder to create individual *.zip* files ***Note: on OS X, "compress" is used to create a .zip***
